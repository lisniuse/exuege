# The pandas community

The community of pandas users and developers is large and decentraliazed. We try to direct certain conversations to certain channels.

1. Use the [#pandas tag on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas) for usage questions (like “How do I do X in pandas?”)
1. Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for
    - **Bug reports** (like “``DataFrame.head()`` returns 6 rows, when it should return 5.”)
    - **Documentation issues** (like “I found this section unclear”)
    - **Feature requests** (like “I think the DataFrame repr should include a pandas emoji next to the shape.”)
1. Use the [pandas dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev) for longer-form discussion items. This is for things that concern the broader pandas community. Most users probably don’t care about an obscure edge-case in ``Series.str.split`` (which should be reported on the issue tracker), but may care about larger-picture things like
    - How should we have discussions about pandas and the community?
    - Developing or adding items to a pandas roadmap
    - Announcing sprints or conference talks
    - Changes to the development workflow
    - Announcements for pandas releases and developer meetings
    - …
1. Use the [pandas gitter](https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas) for quick feedback on development issues
    - I’m having trouble setting up the development environment.
    - I messed up my git branches, can someone take a look?
    - …

To learn more about how to contribute to the ongoing development of pandas, please check out our [contributing guidelines](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/contributing.html). For deeper development discussions related to the direction of the project, you can join the developer [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pandas-dev).

## History of Development

In 2008, pandas development began at [AQR Capital Management](http://www.aqr.com/). By the end of 2009 it had been [open sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), and is actively supported today by a community of like-minded individuals around the world who contribute their valuable time and energy to help make open source pandas possible. Thank you to [all of our contributors](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/contributors).

Since 2015, ``pandas`` is a [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/open-source-projects.html) sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project.
